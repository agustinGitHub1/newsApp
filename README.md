challenge - news app

This app was developed to address a challenge from the company FUDO.

The app was created following these instructions:

1.The design should basically consist of a Header, Body, and Footer.
2.The header should include a news search bar.
3.The main page should display all articles returned on the first page of the request in card format, including title, author, description, and image.
4.The design of the page and cards is completely open-ended. The only restriction is that it should be responsive and should not use any CSS frameworks.
5.Clicking on a card should redirect to a new page displaying only the content of the selected news article.
6.The project should be uploaded to a repository on any platform.
7.The corresponding Dockerfile for building the application image using Nginx should be included in the repository.

Suggestions: 
Consider best practices and keep scalability of the application in mind.

Optional:
Host the application on gh-pages or any other hosting platform.
Add tests.
